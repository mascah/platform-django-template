## Settings

Moved to [settings](https://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1-getting-started/settings.html).

## Basic Commands

### Setting Up Your Users

- To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once you submit it, you'll see a "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to your console to see a simulated email verification message. Copy the link into your browser. Now the user's email should be verified and ready to go.

- To create a **superuser account**, use this command:

      docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml run --rm django python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.

### Type checks

Running type checks with mypy:

    docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml run --rm django mypy {{project_slug}}

### Test coverage

To run the tests, check your test coverage, and generate an HTML coverage report:

    docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml run --rm django coverage run -m pytest
    docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml run --rm django coverage html
    open htmlcov/index.html

#### Running tests with pytest

    docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml run --rm django pytest

### Frontend Development

This project uses Turborepo with pnpm for frontend development.

#### Install dependencies

    pnpm install

#### Development server

    pnpm dev

#### Build for production

    pnpm build

#### Type check

    pnpm typecheck

#### Lint

    pnpm lint

{%- if use_celery %}

### Celery

This app comes with Celery.

To run a celery worker:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up celeryworker
```

Please note: For Celery's import magic to work, it is important _where_ the celery commands are run. If you are in the same folder with _manage.py_, you should be right.

To run [periodic tasks](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/periodic-tasks.html), you'll need to start the celery beat scheduler service:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up celerybeat
```

{%- endif %}
{%- if use_mailpit %}

### Email Server

In development, it is often nice to be able to see emails that are being sent from your application. For that reason local SMTP server [Mailpit](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit) with a web interface is available as docker container.

Container mailpit will start automatically when you will run all docker containers.
Please check [cookiecutter-django Docker documentation](https://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/2-local-development/developing-locally-docker.html) for more details how to start all containers.

With Mailpit running, to view messages that are sent by your application, open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8025`

{%- endif %}
{%- if use_sentry %}

### Sentry

Sentry is an error logging aggregator service. You can sign up for a free account at <https://sentry.io/signup/?code=cookiecutter> or download and host it yourself.
The system is set up with reasonable defaults, including 404 logging and integration with the WSGI application.

You must set the DSN url in production.

Welcome to Cookiecutter Turbo Django
====================================

A project template for building **modular monolith** Django applications with modern frontend tooling.

This template establishes architectural patterns that work for small teams and large organizations. The modular monolith approach means deploying a single unit while keeping clear boundaries between domains.

**New here?** Start with :doc:`0-introduction/why-this-template-cited` to understand the philosophy, or jump to :ref:`template-options` if you're ready to generate a project.

Indices and tables
------------------

* :ref:`genindex`
* :ref:`search`

.. At some point it would be good to have a module index of the high level things we are doing. Then we can * :ref:`modindex` back in.
